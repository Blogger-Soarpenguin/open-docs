        Marathon is a Mesos framework for long-running "always on" apps like Ruby on Rails. It ensures that an app stays up
        even when machines or entire racks fail.
        This tutorial shows you how to run a Ruby on Rails app using Marathon on a Mesos cluster.
          <p>To run a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> app on Mesos, we'll use <a href="https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon">Marathon</a>. Marathon makes it easy to run any long-lived "always on" application on Mesos.</p>
              <p>To get started with the latest Marathon, please follow the <a href="https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs">Getting Started</a> guide.
