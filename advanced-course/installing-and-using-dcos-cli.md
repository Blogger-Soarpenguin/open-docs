This exercise gives you access to various files on the Apache Mesos cluster, among other features.
The best tool for doing this is the [DCOS CLI](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-cli) project which leverages
the latest APIs to give you a full suite of tools.

In this exercise:

1. Follow the installation instructions as described in the DCOS CLI project's [Setup instructions](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-cli#setup) 
2. Use the new ``dcos`` command to work with the cluster in various scenarios.

For more information on what is possible with DCOS CLI, see the [list of commands](https://docs.mesosphere.com/using/cli/).
