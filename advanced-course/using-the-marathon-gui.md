title: Exercise 5 â€“ Using the Marathon GUI

redirect_from:
- /intro-course/ex5.html
---

You can use the Marathon GUI to configure and deploy your applications. In this exercise you will learn how the GUI works and
how to configure and control a simple Python web service.

This exercise is entirely video based. In this exercise:

1. Use the command line to kill the python web server.
2. Watch Marathon bring the Python web server back up.
3. Learn how to scale the app and halt the process.
4. Learn how to use ``$PORT`` to let Marathon assign random ports to your applications.
5. Scale the apps further than 1 node using randomly assigned ports.

Quick Reference
---------------

This exercise is entirely video based, and in the video we:

1. Kill the Python process from exercise 4.
2. Watch the Python process recover.
3. Suspend the Python process which brings it to 0.
4. Bring the process back up by going from 0 to 1 nodes.
5. Make a new Python process with more CPU and RAM.
6. Scale the Python process back up by using the ``$PORT`` variable and then add more nodes.
7. Add 2 more nodes then show the ports working dynamically.

Further Study
-------------

* Try out all of the things shown in the video on your application that was started in exercise 4.
* With the ``$PORT`` variable you can have both the ``SimpleHTTPServer`` and your application live together.  Try it out!
