      <p>To get started launching Chronos, first use <code>ssh</code> to login in to a Mesos master:</p>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">ssh -l ubuntu <span data-replace="master-ip">54.211.52.241</span></code></pre> You can verify that you're on a Mesos master by pinging its health endpoint:</p>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">curl -i localhost:5050/master/health</code></pre>
      <p>The response should be: <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</code>.</p>
  - title: Setup Chronos
    blurb: >
      Download the Chronos package and untar it

      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">tar xzf chronos.tgz &amp;&amp; cd chronos</code></pre>
      <p>If you don't want to download the tar archive, you can use <code>git</code> to clone the repo from <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/chronos">Github</a> and follow the build instructions.</p>
  - title: Launch Chronos
    blurb: >
      Launch the Chronos framework driver on the Mesos master node

    instruction: >
      <p>Then use the start script to bring up Chronos. Use the <code>--master</code> and <code>--zk_hosts</code> command line options to set the Zookeeper hosts:</p>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">./bin/start-chronos.bash --master zk://<span data-replace="zookeeper">localhost:2181</span>/mesos --zk_hosts <span data-replace="zookeeper">zk://localhost:2181/mesos</span> --http_port 8081</code></pre>
      <p>Note the different syntax of the arguments. For a full list of options run the start script with <code>--help</code>.</p>
      <p>You should see that Chronos registered to the Mesos master, and that it started its web server on port <code>8081</code>. At the end there should be notices about resource offers. Since we don't have any tasks launched yet, these offers should be getting declined by Chronos.</p>
  - title: Go to the Chronos UI
    blurb: >
      Explore the rich Chronos UI
    icon: fa-list-alt
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_00_start.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Great. Now let's move over to a browser and open the Chronos web UI on port <code>8081</code> of the Mesos master that we were just using: <code>http://<span data-replace="master-ip">localhost</span>:8081</code></p>
      <p>Next we'll create an example job to run.</p>
  - title: Create a Job
    blurb: >
      Use the Chronos UI to create your first job
    icon: fa-plus
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_01_new_job.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>In the bottom left part of the screen, click on the
      <b>New Job</b> button to create a new job in Chronos.</p>
      <p>Check out the dark sidebar -- the panel on the right-hand side. To create a job, we need to fill in values for the job's name, command, and schedule. In this case, let's create a job called <code>foo</code> that runs the command <code>sleep 1</code></p>
      <p>Enter the current time in UTC into the time (T) field, and <code>T1M</code> into the period (P) field to repeat the job once a minute. Be sure to convert from your local timezone to UTC or you'll get a big surprise. Then click the <b>Create</b> button at the top.</p>
  - title: Explore your job
    blurb: >
      Find your job in the Chronos UI
    icon: fa-search
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_02_schedule.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      Okay, now you have a job called <code>foo</code> scheduled to
      run. Wait until its scheduled time, then check the Chronos UI again.
  - title: Observe the status change of your job
    blurb: >
      See how the job state changes to success after your job runs on Mesos
    icon: fa-eye
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_03_success.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>The UI should show success! The dark sidebar should show the last time that the job ran successfully.</p>
      <p>Note that after the job runs a few times its runtime statistics will begin to show up.</p>
  - title: Explore the basic Mesos UI
    blurb: >
      See how Mesos and Chronos interoperate and look at the Mesos task generated by the Chronos job
    icon: fa-list-alt
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_04_finished.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Great. Now let's open another browser window for the Mesos web UI -- the URL is the Mesos master IP address on port <code>5050</code>, which is <code>http://<span data-replace="master-ip">localhost</span>:5050</code> in this case.</p>
      <p>Click on the Chronos link under <b>Active Frameworks</b> to show its task history. There should be a <code>foo</code> task in a <code>FINISHED</code> state, listed under the completed tasks. Click on the <b>Sandbox</b> link to open the files associated with the completed task.</p>
  - title: Explore advanced Mesos UI features
    blurb: >
      We can debug jobs and look at their output by using the sandbox thatâ€™s created by Mesos for each of the Mesos tasks
    icon: fa-compass
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_05_sandbox.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Then click on the <code>stdout</code> link to open the standard
      output from the <code>foo</code> job, all 364 bytes of it...</p>
  - title: Look at the Mesos task output
    blurb: >
      Navigate through the sandbox to see the output in the pailer
    icon: fa-code
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_06_stdout.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>That should pop up a window showing how the executor ran the
      <code>foo</code> job, with a <code>0</code> status returned.</p>
  - title: Create a complex task in the Chronos UI
    blurb: >
      Use the rich Chronos UI to create a more elaborate job
    icon: fa-plus
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_07_bar.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Let's see about configuring a more complex task, one that has
      more than one job in a dependency graph. Go back to the Chronos
      UI and create a new job called <code>bar</code> which has the
      same parameters as <code>foo</code> but with its scheduled time
      a few more minutes ahead. Also add your email in the owner tab.
      Then click the <b>Create</b> button at the top.</p>
  - title: Add job dependency
    blurb: >
      Create a job dependency that will trigger a follow-up job upon completion of the parent job
    icon: fa-plus
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_08_baz.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Now create a second job called <code>baz</code> with a command
      <code>echo "DONE"</code> and set its parent to the <code>bar</code>
      job. Since this is a dependent job, it won't need a scheduled time or
      owner. Then click the <b>Create</b> button at the top.</p>
  - title: Job overview
    blurb: >
      Go back to the Chronos UI and look at all jobs that were created
    icon: fa-list-alt
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_09_baz.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>You should see three jobs now: the first job which already
      completed, and the two pending jobs. On the lower left of the
      window, click on the <b>Dependency Graph</b> button.</p>
  - title: Explore the dependency graph
    blurb: >
      Navigate to the dependency graph that shows all jobs and their dependencies on one another
    icon: fa-compass
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_10_depend.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Great, see the dependency graph rendered? The <code>foo</code> job is green because it finished successfully. The <code>bar</code> job has an arc directed into the <code>baz</code> job, and both are in white because they are still pending. This becomes much more interesting when the dependency graph among jobs becomes more complex.</p>
      <p>Next, click the big "X" in the top right to dismiss this display.</p>
  - title: Job overview
    blurb: >
      See how the job status changes once the jobs finish running
    icon: fa-eye
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_11_success.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Wait for the scheduled time, then you should see that both of the pending jobs have completed.</p>
  - title: Explore the Mesos UI
    blurb: >
      Find all tasks corresponding to the Chronos jobs in the Mesos UI
    icon: fa-search
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_12_finished.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Did those both finish? You're doing awesome. Now let's go back to
      the Mesos console and look at the task list. Both the <code>bar</code>
      and <code>baz</code> jobs should be finished.</p>
      <p>Click on the <b>Sandbox</b> link for the <code>baz</code> job.</p>
  - title: Look at the job output
    blurb: >
      Use the Mesos UI to find the sandbox where you can view the job output
    icon: fa-list-alt
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/chronos_13_stdout.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Check toward the bottom of the job's standard out &mdash; there
      should be a ginormous <code>DONE</code> echoed to the output.</p>
success:
  title: Next steps

    A slightly more detailed description for what happens in this step of the tutorial
