      <p>We need to install Ruby 2.0 and <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> on the Mesos slaves to be able to run Rails apps. Gem dependencies are included in the application tarball and loaded via Bundler. Run the command below from your local machine to install Ruby and Bundler.</p>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">servers=(<span data-replace="slave-external-ip-list">slave1.example.com slave2.example.com slave3.example.com</span>); for s in "${servers[@]}"; do ssh -l ubuntu $s 'sudo apt-get -y install ruby2.0 &amp;&amp; sudo gem install bundler' ; done</code></pre>
      <p>Note: Ruby 2.0 is only available on Ubuntu 13.04 or later. On other Linux distributions you might have to use an older version, or add a third party source to get the packages.</p>
  - title: Launch Rails
    blurb: >
      Navigate to the Marathon web UI and launch your Rails app
    icon: fa-play
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/rails_create.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Next, navigate to the Marathon web UI at <code>http://<span data-replace="master-ip">54.211.52.241</span>:8080</code>. Click the NEW button to start a new app. Fill in the following:</p>

      <h6>ID</h6>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">Hello</code></pre>
      <h6>COMMAND</h6>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">cd hello &amp;&amp; RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec unicorn -p $PORT</code></pre>
      <h6>MEMORY</h6>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">100</code></pre>
      <h6>CPUS</h6>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">1</code></pre>
      <h6>INSTANCES</h6>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">1</code></pre>
      <h6>URIS</h6>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">https://downloads.mesosphere.io/tutorials/RailsHello.tgz</code></pre>
      <p>Click the start button to launch your app.</p>
  - title: Explore the Marathon UI
    blurb: >
      Play with the Marathon web UI to confirm that Rails is running
    icon: fa-check
    blackboard: >
      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/rails_running.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>The web UI should now show your running app. Mouse over the row and click to see the details. The UI allows you to scale an app up or down by setting the number of instances to run. You can suspend an app (equal to scaling to 0), and destroy it, which deletes all information about the app and is irreversible.</p>
  - title: Connect to your Rails app
    blurb: >
      Use the Marathon REST API to find out where your Rails app is running and connect to it
    icon: fa-trophy
    blackboard: >
      <pre class="terminal"><code>bash-3.2$ curl http://<span data-replace="master-ip">54.211.52.241</span>:8080/v1/endpoints

      Hello_12402 12402 ec2-54-221-124-180.compute-1.amazonaws.com:31758</code></pre>

      <span data-img-placeholder
        data-alt=""
        data-class="thumbnail img-responsive"
        data-src="{% asset_path learn/rails_out.jpg %}"></span>
    instruction: >
      <p>Next, let's use the Marathon REST API to find out where your Rails app is running. You can get a list of the app instances like this:</p>
      <pre data-code><code class="codeblock">curl http://<span data-replace="master-ip">54.211.52.241</span>:8080/v1/endpoints</code></pre>
      <p>The first column in the output is the app ID and the global app port separated by an underscore. The second column is the global app port. All following columns are hostname and port pairs of the running app instances. Copy &amp; paste the hostname and port into a browser and you should see a running Rails application.</p>

  title: Next steps
  blurb: >
    A slightly more detailed description for what happens in this step of the tutorial
  text: >
    <p>Congratulations! You now have Ruby on Rails running on Mesos!</p>
    <h4>Bonus Points</h4>
    <p>If you were wondering what the global app port is, Marathon exposes it for load balancing. For bonus points, try running <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a> on each cluster node so that requests to the global app port are proxied to each instance within the cluster. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/bin/haproxy-marathon-bridge">sample script</a> to get started with. <a href="/getting-started/service-discovery/">Read more</a> about service discovery with Mesosphere.</p>
